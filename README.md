<p style="color:red">Hi, I am Tashnin Hossain from BBS department of BRACU. Basically I live at elephant road. My preferable genres of music are basically pop, melody, r&b. I also watch movies, fantasy movies are my favorite. My recent hobby is graphics designing, I did a course on it. That's all sums up me. :)</p>
